# Accessible JavaScript Deep Dive Codebase

[AccessU 2022 Accessible JavaScript Deep Dive](https://knowbility.org/programs/accessu-2022/deep-dive-accessible-javascript) codebase in four different frameworks: React, Vue, Svelte, and Angular. 

Each project is the same sample app written for each framework, with unit and integration tests set up that run axe-core.

## Project Setup

For ease of use, all dependencies for each of the projects have been added as a dependency of the root package.json. This means you can run the install script once and be able to run all scripts from all projects.

You can also run the install script in the project directories themselves.

```sh
npm install
```
